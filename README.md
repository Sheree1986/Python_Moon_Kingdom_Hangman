## [Moon Kingdom Transformation (Hangman)](https://replit.com/@Sheree1986/MoonKingdom#main.py)



This python application take a spin on the classic game of hangman. Sailor Moon is one of my first and all time favorite anime. 
Instead of the tradition "hanging", it is replaced with a transformation. In order to win a user has 10 attempts to guess the correct word 
before Sailor Moon completes her transformation.

#### Machineries Used

1. Python - [python-3.10.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Pip - [pip 22.2.2](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/)
3. Pygame [Pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)

### Technical requirements ‚öôÔ∏è
- [X] You must create an app using the newly learn programming language via self-study (Python)
- [X] Be a complete product
- [X] Implement thoughtful user stories
- [X] Meet MVP and MPV2 outlined

### Necessary Deliverables üèÅ
- [x] Your project idea (a brief 2-3 sentence description of your app)
- [x] A README.md


### User Stories ÔøΩ
- [x] As a user I should be able to click a button to either start a new game or exit the main menu
- [x] As a user I should be able to click on a letter to guess a word
- [x] As a user the correct word should appear in the guess area
- [x] As a user once a letter is pressed it show not be visible or clickable 
- [x] As a user I should get 10 guesses to find the word correct. If not I am taken to a lost screen.
- [x] As a user will be taking to a win screen if the correct word is guessed
- [x] As a user I should hear the Sailor Moon Theme song playing in the background
- [x] As a user I should hear a sound when a letter is pressed in the game screen
- [x] As a user I can click a restart button during game play to restart game
- [x] As a user words should randomly 





#### Struggles
The restart button functionality was the most difficult code to create. I had to use pseudo code to add my logic. Then finally figure out how to stop the restart button from glitching.
The glitch was created by a pygame.display.update in the wrong place. Another struggle was getting the app deployed. Because of the risk to cyber security it was decided not to create a .exe file. Replit an online IDE was used to deploy the game.
